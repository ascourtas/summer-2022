# Summer 2022 Student Repo
This repository is for our summer students to create a page about themselves and what they've worked on this summer.

## How to contribute
We follow a [Pull Request workflow](https://medium.com/@urna.hybesis/pull-request-workflow-with-git-6-steps-guide-3858e30b5fa4), which is commonly used in open source projects as well as in industry. To contribute to this repo, follow these steps:

1. `git pull` the latest code to your machine.
2. `git checkout -b branch-name` to create a branch (filling in `branch-name` with the name of your branch) where you'll be making changes.
3. `git commit` and `git push` your code to this branch.
4. When you have changes you'd like to merge into `main`, [create a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)
5.  Message Ari or KJ that you have a PR that needs to be reviewed. Ari and KJ may have feedback you need to address before merging your branch into `main`.
6.  Once all feedback has been addressed, Ari or KJ will merge your branch into `main`.
